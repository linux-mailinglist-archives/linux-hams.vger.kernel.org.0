Good day Dear favoured one,

Calvary Greetings in the name of the LORD Almighty and Our LORD JESUS

will definitely come to you as a huge
surprise, but I implore you to take the time to go through it
carefully as the decision you make will go off a long way to determine
my future and continued existence. I am Mrs. Estelle Herve aging widow

funds I inherited from my late husband, The sum of (US$8.5 Million
Dollars) and I needed a very honest and God fearing who can withdraw
this money then use the funds for Charity works. I WISH TO GIVE THIS
FUNDS TO YOU FOR CHARITY WORKS.I found your contact through social
network after honest prayers to the LORD to bring me a helper and i
decided to contact you if you may be willing and interested to handle
these trust funds in good faith before anything happens to me.

I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will
inherit this money after I die. I want your urgent reply to me so that
I will give you the deposit receipt which
the BANK issued to me as next of kin for immediate transfer of the
money to your account in your country, to start the good work of God,
I want you to use the 40/percent of the total amount to help yourself
in doing the project.

I am desperately in keen need of assistance and I have summoned up
courage to contact you for this task, you must not fail me and the
millions of the poor people in our today=E2=80=99s
WORLD. This is not stolen money and there are no dangers involved,100%
RISK FREE with full legal proof. Please if you would be able to use
the funds for the Charity works kindly let me know immediately. I will
appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this matter to
accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that will
jeopardize my last wish. I want you to take 40 percent of the total
money for your personal use while 60% of the money will go to charity.
I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this
matter to accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that
will jeopardize my last wish as i said before please.

Finally, i will give you more details about the project as soon as I
receive your reply in my private email (estelleherve03@gmail.com) to
handle this project because I do not want to state all here until I
see your reply, desire and commitment to handle this project.
