Hello Ivan,

Thank you for posting this video and bug report at 
https://github.com/ve7fet/linuxax25/issues/9#issuecomment-599236879 .  
With this easier to reproduce scenario, maybe we can find a kernel 
developer to help us debug and fix this issue.  Finding this resource to 
fix this has been a serious challenge so far.
