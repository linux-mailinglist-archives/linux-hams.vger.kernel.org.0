I saw this very sad news today on the AMPR list but didn't see it here 
so I thought I would forward it on.  I do hope that the UroNode and his 
larger body of his Linux work can be continued but I don't know if Brian 
had any specific plans, wishes, etc.

RIP Brian.  Thank you for all your work and support to the packet community!

It is with great sadness that I pass along the news that Brian Rogers N1URO
is now a silent key. He passed on Tuesday evening January 4th, 2022.
  

Brian was the author of the URONode packet radio software and past president
of the Eastnet Amateur Radio Network (https://www.eastnetpacket.org/). He
was an avid packet user and contributor to various software packages, not
just his own. He was also the AmprNet coordinator for the states of MA, NH,
VT, PA, MD, DE, CT, RI and ME.

  
Professionally his was an IT consultant and ran his company Network
Continuum Connecticut (https://www.nc-ct.net/).


He was a mentor to many who wanted to operate packet nodes or set up an
apmr.org station. He had a broad knowledge of many other node operating
systems, keeping nodes of all types running at his QTH. He was a wealth of
detailed knowledge and will be missed immensely.
  

Funeral arrangements are;
