Hello Mike,

Thank you for trying to move things working but as Thomas dl9sau chimed 
in, he has restored the original AX.25 server and it's services 
including the Wiki, Git, etc. to a new domain:

    https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de/wiki/Main_Page


To avoid confusion found via Internet searches, please remove that newly 
created https://github.com/linux-ax25 repo.  Thank you.

--David
