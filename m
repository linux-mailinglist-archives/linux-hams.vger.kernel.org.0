Good Day,

Accept my apologies for writing you a surprise letter. I am Mrs. Kacey
Maquire, General operation and Regional Accountant of First Pillar
Finance Bank, United Kingdom. I hope that you will not expose or
betray this trust and confidence that I am about to impose on you. I
have a very important interest that I would like to discuss with you
regarding one of our late customers who had a fixed deposit account in
our bank. I have been in search of someone with the same last name of
yours, so when I saw your name, I was pushed to contact you for our
mutual benefit.

I have the opportunity to transfer the sum of (GBP=C2=A3 6,300,000) to you.
I would like to invest these funds and introduce you to our bank as
the beneficiary of the deceased client for this transaction. All I
need is your sincere cooperation and I promise this will be done under
a legitimate agreement that will protect us from any violation of the
law. I agree that 40% of this money will go to you as my foreign
partner, 50% to me, while 10% will go to establish a foundation for
the underprivileged people in your country. If you would like to hear
me out, I will provide you with full details of this transaction in
your reply to this letter.

Thank you for your urgent response.

Regards,
Mrs. Kacey Maquire.
